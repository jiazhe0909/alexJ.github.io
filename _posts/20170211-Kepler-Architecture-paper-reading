Roofline Model can be used to bound Floating-point performance as a function of machine peak performance, machine peak bandwidth, and arithmetic intensity.[](http://crd.lbl.gov/departments/computer-science/PAR/research/roofline)
shared memory transaction size is 256 Byte,thus 1 warp of LDS.128 need at least 2 transactions. 
LDS.64 bandwidth is higher than LDS.128 bandwidth,and LDS.128 even could become the bottleneck of 12x12 sgemm implementation.
Arithmetic intensity
Kepler L1 cache is designed for local rather then global mem access.
Texture Cache is faster because of its weak consistency.
K20: global mem bandwidth : ~200GB/s
     shared mem bandwidth : ~2349GB/s
