Please correct me, if anything is wrong.

LDG.CI is load data from global memory though read only cache(non-coherent cache). LDG.CI could be generated with \_ldg() or const \_\_restrict\_\_.

LDC is load data from constant memory, and constant memory could do broadcast for all threads in one warp.

LDU is outdated, included in Fermi architecture. njuffa mentioned LDU load through constant cache and could also broadcast(some feature of load uniform).
