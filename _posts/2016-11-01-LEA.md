Please correct me, if anything is wrong.

There are some interesting features in some of X86 architecture, I was wondering if some of those could also apply for nvidia GPU so that bring us some performance advantage.

1 LEA calculate memory address but doesn't actually address memory.

2 LEA could deal with 3 operands(more operands than IADD instruction)

3 LEA instruction does not change the condition flag, while ADD or MUL does. This feature might decreases the level of dependency among instructions and thus makes room for further optimization by the compiler or hardware scheduler.

4 LEA instruction on nvidia Maxwell can only support shift operations, such as multiply by 1, 2,4,8. Because it doesn't not have enough bit to store operand. 

5 Another thing about LEA instruction. You can also use LEA for fast multiplying registers by 3, 5 or 9.

    LEA EAX, [EAX * 2 + EAX]   ;EAX = EAX * 3
    LEA EAX, [EAX * 4 + EAX]   ;EAX = EAX * 5
    LEA EAX, [EAX * 8 + EAX]   ;EAX = EAX * 9

the reason we use it is to set our arithmatic units free(in some architecture, LEA and MUL use different hardware unit) and thus increase ILP.
